# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into different categories. The notebook `Image_Classification2.ipynb` demonstrates the complete workflow ‚Äî from loading the dataset to training and evaluating the model.

## üìò Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying images using TensorFlow and Keras.  
The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Model building using CNN layers  
- Training and validation  
- Model saving (`happysadmodel.h5`)  
- Evaluation and visualization of accuracy/loss curves

---

## üß† Model Architecture

The CNN model is built using Keras (TensorFlow backend) and typically includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Flattening and Dense layers  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Output layer with Softmax/Sigmoid activation (depending on number of classes)
